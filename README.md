âœ¨ Distributed Event-Driven Task Management System in Go
This project is a scalable, event-driven backend platform built in Go, designed to demonstrate modern concurrency patterns, clean REST APIs, and horizontal scalability with a custom load balancer. 

ðŸ›  Features
1. Task Management API
Create, update, retrieve, and delete tasks with persistent MongoDB storage.

2.Event Broadcasting System
Publish and subscribe to events in real time over Server-Sent Events (SSE).

3.Custom Load Balancer
Automatically distributes incoming requests to the backend instance with the lowest load.

4.Concurrency & Synchronization
Uses mutexes, channels, and context cancellation for safe concurrent processing.

5.Graceful Shutdown
Ensures all requests complete before stopping servers.

6.Automated Load Testing
Includes a Go-based test client to simulate high request volumes.

7.Scalable Design
Multiple backend instances run in parallel, demonstrating horizontal scaling.

ðŸš€ Technologies
Go â€” Fast, efficient server logic
MongoDB â€” Flexible document storage for tasks and events
Gin â€” High-performance HTTP web framework
Server-Sent Events (SSE) â€” Real-time event streaming
Custom Load Balancer â€” Written in Go to distribute load dynamically

ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?
This project showcases:
How Goâ€™s concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels, sync) make it easy to build highly concurrent, low-latency systems.
A fully working example of event-driven architecture with real-time updates.
Clean separation of concerns and maintainable modular design.
A starting point for building production-grade distributed services.

How to Run this project?
Open 5 terminaals 
1st : PORT=5000 go run main.go
2nd : PORT=5001 go run main.go
3rd : PORT=5002 go run main.go
4th navigate to the loadBalancer/ : go run balancer.go
5th navigate to the testData/ : go run Test.go

then if we see the log of balancer.go we can able to see which request is handled by which server.
